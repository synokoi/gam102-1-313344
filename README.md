For my Gam102 project I have decided to make an emotional prototype centered around the feeling of nostalgia. To achieve this I will be creating a scene on a swing in a field where every time you push the swing forward it also pushes time forwards. This is meant to create that feeling of time slipping away whilst also using a swing for imagery of being young. 
I will also be adding my own music that whilst being in major to sound joyful it will slowly move down in keys to also aid with the feeling of loss. 
I also want everything in the scene to feel slightly off like a memory that is slightly warped. For the scene itself I want to place some things that don't quite feel like they fit their location. As for the music I will make the piece on instruments tuned a half step down and record it in a way that allows for some background noise and imperfections to aid to this.
